    "description": "Using the loose equality operator (==) can cause unexpected behavior as it performs type coercion before comparing. This can lead to subtle bugs where values that are not actually equivalent are treated as equal. For example, `0 == '0'` evaluates to true, but these are different types and values.",
    "code_snippet": "function validateInput(value) {\n  if (value == 0) { // Loose equality comparison\n    return false;\n  }\n  return true;\n}",
    "recommendation": "Replace loose equality operators (==, !=) with strict equality operators (===, !==) to avoid type coercion bugs. This ensures both the value and type are compared."
